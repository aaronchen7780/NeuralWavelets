# Neural Wavelets for Time Series Compression

FinalReport.pdf details the work David Luo and I have put in to developing a time-series compression model based on Neural Wavelets in our time at Carnegie Mellon University. 

The paper has been peer-reviewed by professors and PhD students in CMU's Department of Machine Learning.

Since graduating in December of 2023, I've stepped away from actively contributing to the project. However, I still work in an advisory capacity whenever the need arises.
